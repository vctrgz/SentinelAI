You MUST return JSON:

```json
{
  "approved": [
    {"kind": "tool", "tool": "read_file", "params": {"path": "src/app.py"}, "risk": "low"}
  ],
  "needs_confirmation": [
    {"kind": "shell", "cmd": "pip install -r requirements.txt", "reason": "installs dependencies"}
  ]
}
```

Compatibility rule:
